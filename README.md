#  Java Data Structures & Algorithms

Welcome to my **Java Data Structures & Algorithms** repository! This project serves as a comprehensive collection of my journey learning and mastering Java, from the fundamental building blocks to complex algorithmic patterns.

## Project Overview

This repository is structured to document a progressive learning path. It starts with basic Java syntax and logic, moves into core Data Structures, and advances to specialized problem-solving patterns used in competitive programming and technical interviews.

##  Directory Structure

### 1. [Basic_of_Java](./Basic_of_Java)
Foundational Java concepts and initial coding exercises.
- **Core Concepts**: Loops (`Forloop`, `Whileloop`, `DoWhileLoop`), Conditional Logic (`IfElse`, `SwitchCase`), and Input Handling.
- **Math & Logic**: `OddEven`, `SumOfNNautralNumbers`, `Variable` basics.
- **Pattern Printing**: multiple pattern printing exercises (`Pattern1` to `AdvPattern1`) to build logic building skills.

### 2. [DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)](./DSA)
The core of the repository, logically organized by topic.
- **Linear Data Structures**:
  - `Arrays` & `Arrays_Patterns`
  - `LinkedList`
  - `StackTechnique`
  - `Queue`
  - `Strings`
- **Non-Linear Data Structures**:
  - `Tree`
  - `HashSet` & `Collectionframework`
- **Algorithms & Techniques**:
  - `Recursion`
  - `Sortings`
  - `SlidingWindow`
  - `TwoPointerApproach`

### 3. [PatternPractice](./PatternPractice)
Focused practice on identifying and applying specific algorithmic patterns. This is crucial for recognizing problem types in interviews.
- **Binary Search**: Implementing and applying binary search in various scenarios.
- **Sliding Window**: Fixed and variable size window problems.
- **Two Pointers**: Techniques for optimized searches in sorted/unsorted arrays.
- **Stack**: Monotonic stack and other stack-based patterns.

### 4. Practice & Miscellaneous
- **[Practice1](./Practice1)**: General practice problems including voting logic and circumference calculations.
- **[Round0](./Round0)**: Initial rounds of coding questions and basic problem-solving (e.g., Two Sum, Max Subarray).

##  Why This Repository?
- **Structured Learning**: logical progression from basics to advanced topics.
- **Clean Code**: Focus on readable and maintainable Java implementation.
- **Interview Prep**: Covers high-frequency topics found in technical interviews (FAANG + others).

##  Tech Stack
- **Language**: Java
- **Tools**: VS Code

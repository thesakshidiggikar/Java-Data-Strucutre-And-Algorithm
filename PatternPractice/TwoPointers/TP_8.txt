Problem:
Move all zeroes to the end while maintaining relative order.

Pattern:
Two Pointers

Brute Force Idea:
Create a new array and append zeros later.

Optimized Two Pointers Idea:
- One pointer tracks non-zero position
- Swap non-zero elements forward

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Problem:
Given an elevation map, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

Pattern:
Two Pointers

Brute Force Idea:
For each bar, find max left and right height.

Optimized Two Pointers Idea:
- Use left and right pointers
- Maintain leftMax and rightMax
- Move smaller height pointer

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Edge Cases:
- Less than 3 bars

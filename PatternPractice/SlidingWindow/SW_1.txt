Problem:
Given an array of integers and an integer K, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size K.

Intuition:
We want the best window of size K. Brute force checks all windows.
Optimized approach slides the window by removing left element and adding right.

Brute Force Approach:
Check every subarray of size K and compute sum.

Time Complexity: O(n * k)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Optimized Approach (Sliding Window):
- Calculate sum of first K elements
- Slide window by subtracting element going out and adding new element

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Dry Run:
Array = [2,1,5,1,3,2], K = 3
Window [2,1,5] → sum = 8
Slide → [1,5,1] → sum = 7
Slide → [5,1,3] → sum = 9 (max)

Edge Cases:
- K > array length
- Array with negative numbers

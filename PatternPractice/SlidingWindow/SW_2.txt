Problem:
Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Window Type:
Variable window

Brute Force Idea:
Generate all substrings and check uniqueness using a set.

Optimized Sliding Window Idea:
- Use two pointers (left, right)
- Use a HashSet to track characters
- Expand right, shrink left when duplicate found

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

Dry Run:
s = "abcabcbb"

Edge Cases:
- empty string
- all same characters

Problem:
Find longest substring after replacing at most k characters.

Window Type:
Variable window

Brute Force Idea:
Try all substrings and count replacements.

Optimized Sliding Window Idea:
- Maintain frequency of chars
- Track max frequency in window
- If window size - maxFreq > k → shrink

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(26)

Edge Cases:
- k = 0

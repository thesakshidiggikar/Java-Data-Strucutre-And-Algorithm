Problem:
Find the minimum window in string s which contains all characters of string t.

Window Type:
Variable window (with frequency count)

Brute Force Idea:
Check all substrings and verify if they contain t.

Optimized Sliding Window Idea:
- Maintain frequency map of t
- Expand window till valid
- Shrink window to minimum

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1) / O(128)

Edge Cases:
- t longer than s
- characters not present

Problem:
Check if s2 contains a permutation of s1.

Window Type:
Fixed window (size = len(s1))

Brute Force Idea:
Check all substrings of size len(s1) and compare frequency.

Optimized Sliding Window Idea:
- Frequency array of s1
- Slide fixed window on s2
- Compare counts

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(26)

Edge Cases:
- s1 longer than s2
